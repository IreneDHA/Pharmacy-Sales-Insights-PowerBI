# Pharmacy Sales Analytics 2024

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project analyzes pharmacy sales during 2024 using **Power BI**.  
The goal was to identify trends in product formats, sales distribution, and customer behavior over time.  
Three dashboards were created to explore product performance, basket composition, and temporal patterns.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Source: [Pharmacy Transactional Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/goransaman/pharmacy-transactional-dataset)

## ðŸŽ¨ Design
- Visualization tool: **Power BI**
- Color palette: [Pharmacy Color Palette â€“ Piktochart](https://piktochart.com/tips/pharmacy-color-palette)

## ðŸ“‘ Dashboards
1. **Data Context**  
   - Dosage forms available  
   - Products available  
   - Packs sold / Sheets sold  
   - Top 5 dosage forms  
   - Sales by product type  

2. **Product Analysis**  
   - Average sheets and packs sold per invoice  
   - Sales distribution by sheets or packs  
   - Top products sold in sheets and packs  

3. **Temporal Analysis**  
   - Sales distribution throughout the year  
   - Monthly, weekly, and daily/hourly breakdowns (blisters and packs)

## âœ… Key Conclusions
- The pharmacy processed **1247435 invoices** in 2024.  
- Blister sales are roughly double those of packs.  
- Tablets account for more than half of dosage form sales, despite hundreds of dosage form options.  
- Many top-selling products are not available in pack formats, limiting pack sales potential.  
- Pack sales increase during holiday months such as **March** and **July**.  
- Weekly sales peak on **Thursdays** and are lowest on **Fridays**.  
- Although open 24/7, the pharmacyâ€™s busiest times are **08:00â€“10:00** and **19:00â€“20:00**.  

## ðŸš€ Recommendations
- Prioritize tablets and blisters in merchandising and inventory planning.  
- Expand pack or multipack availability for top-selling products to capture missed opportunities.  
- Align staffing and pharmacist availability with peak hours.  
- Use targeted promotions on slower days (e.g., Fridays) to smooth weekly demand.
